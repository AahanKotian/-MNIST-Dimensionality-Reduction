# -MNIST-Dimensionality-Reduction
I will work with the famous MNIST dataset, which is a set of images of handwritten digits https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database.

Handwritten Digit Recognition:
This project aims to classify images of handwritten digits from 0-9 using the popular MNIST dataset and a multi-layer perceptron neural network model.

The Dataset:
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels in size and labeled with the correct digit class from 0-9.
